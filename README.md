# Detecting-Safety-Hazards-in-the-Construction-Industry

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to enhance safety measures in construction sites by ensuring
that workers and individuals are wearing the necessary protective equipment, specifically
helmets and vests. This is achieved through an object detection model that identifies whether
these items are being worn.

The approach involves leveraging transfer learning with the YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once) model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, retrained using a labeled dataset from Roboflow Universe. The dataset includes images annotated with the presence or absence of helmets and vests.
